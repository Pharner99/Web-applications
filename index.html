		<p> Welcome to my homepage, here I will put information about me and what I do.<br/>
			I will be putting my accomplishments and projects here also,<br/>
			 I don't really have any right now but im sure to get some in the future.<br/>
	 		 You are free to explore my page to get a feel of who I am, have a nice day!</p>	
		<h5> Educational goal </h5>
			<p> The goals I have made for my education are to learn how to design and code websites.<br/>
				Right now I don't have a specific plan to acheive this goal and I still <br/>
				dont exactly know if it's what I want to do, but never the less it is something <br/>
				to think on for next year, but other then that I will strive to get better grades <br/>
				and really get my act together because I haven't been doing well in anything but <br/>
				I think I have really improved a bit sense my last years. Those are my educational <br/> 
				goals I have made for myself.</p>
		<h5> Employment goal </h5>
			<p>My goals for being employed are as follows, I want a job that not only has a decent pay but <br/>
				is something i can enjoy for the rest of my life, I feel that nothing else matters if you don't <br/>
				enjoy what you do whether it be game programming to web design and if you dont have that then <br/>
				you have an occupation that your going to go your whole life regreting and hating it.</p>

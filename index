		<h5> Educational goal </h5>
			<p> The goals I have made for my education are to learn how to design and code websites.<br/>
				Right now I don't have a specific plan to acheive this goal and I still <br/>
				dont exactly know if it's what I want to do, but never the less it is something <br/>
				to think on for next year. but other then that I will strive to get better grades <br/>
				and really get my act together because I haven't been doing well in anything but <br/>
				I think I have really improved a bit sense my last years. Those are my educational <br/> 
				goals i have made for myself.
			</p>
		<h5> Employment goal </h5>
			<p>My goals for being employed are as follows, I want a job that not only has a decent pay but <br/>
				is something i can enjoy for the rest of my life, I feel that nothing else matters if you don't <br/>
				enjoy what you do whether it be game programming to web design and if you dont have that then <br/>
				you have an occupation that your going to go your whole life regreting and hate it.

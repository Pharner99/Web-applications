				<h3>Things about me</h3>
		<p>I go to Miami Valley Career Technology Center but my homeschool is Milton Union High school, it's a pretty small school that is made up of three buildings,
		and it's really not much, but the teachers there are nice and it's not half bad.
		My hometown is the small village of West Milton, it's actually not big enough to be called a town,
			 there isn't much but there is still some fun stuff to do like walk around, going to the park,
			and that's about it.
	I enjoy playing video games and frequently playing card games with my friends, I also to walk around 
		with my friends too, I don't do much. I have two pets I have a dog named Finn and a fish.</p>

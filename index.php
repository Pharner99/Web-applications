				<p> Welcome to my homepage, here I will put information about me and what I do.<br/>
			I will be putting my accomplishments and projects here also, <br/>
			 I don't really have any right now but I’m sure to get some in the future. <br/>
	 		 You are free to explore my page to get a feel of who I am, have a nice day! </p>
		<h5> Educational goal </h5>
			<p> The goals I have made for my education are to learn how to design and code websites.<br/>
				Right now I don't have a specific plan to achieve this goal and I still <br/>
				don’t exactly know if it's what I want to do, but never the less it is something <br/>
				To think on for next year, but other than that I will strive to get better grades <br/>
				And really get my act together because I haven't been doing well in anything but <br/>
				I think I have really improved a bit sense my last years. Those are my educational <br/>
				Goals I have made for myself.</p>
		<h5> Employment goal </h5>
			<p>my goals for being employed are as follows, I want a job that not only has a decent pay but <br/>
				is something i can enjoy for the rest of my life, I feel that nothing else matters if you don't <br/>
				enjoy what you do whether it be game programming to web design and if you don’t have that then <br/>
				You have an occupation that you’re going to go your whole life regretting and hating it.</p>
